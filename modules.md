# Overview

Guidelines:
- should include theory to bootstrap learning
- should include practice in order to test theory and highlight context effects 

## Basic : developers

### scope

Duration: 3 days
Creation: 6 days

### Pre-requisite

Know the relational model
- what is a table, a primary key, a foreign key 
- write and execute basic SQL queries, at least a SELECT with JOIN and a WHERE clause

### foundation

Choose the database you need.

Several paradigm:
- key/value: redis
- relational: PostgreSQL
- graph: 
- document: ElasticSearch
- hybrid

### local environment

Being able to start a database server  locally and run queries against it using a client.

Use Docker and compose to start a Postgresql server :
- configure exposed port, credentials and database name ;
- use healthcheck to make sure it's properly started ;
- know you data won't be persisted between container restart ;
- know the memory usage is limited to a small extent by default by Postgresql itself ;
- know the CPU and I/O usage is not limited by default ;
- know you can change resource usage using [pgtune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) and `postgresql.conf`.

Using a CLI :
- `psql` client
   - interactive mode, to get schema description and run SQL queries
   - file mode, to run scripts
- [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/)

### using your database

SQL:
- Queries: SELECT, CTE, views
- DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE
- DDL: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE

Data model:
- logical model : primary key, foreign keys, contraints (unique not null, function)
- physical model : partition

Business data type:
- facts
- dimension
- configuration

Should you 
- expose primary keys to other applications ?
- use technical id, application-generated (uuid) or functional (composite) ?

### import data

CSV using `COPY FROM`

### libraries

Basics of:
- client with/without connexion pool
- transactions
- query-builder
- ORM

### development best practice

Schema versioning:
- key concepts
- Java: liquibase
- Js: knex

No-downtime deployment (ZDD):
- key concepts
- practice: rename a column in three deployments

Linting (optional):
- naming standards
- constraints: primary key and foreign keys

## Medium : technical leaders and senior developers

### Scope

Duration: 6 days

Day 1 : performance
- heap : large random-access files
- cache : speed up queries
  - choose its size, modify it
  - find its content, clear it
- MVCC and its impact on performance
  - visibility map (a glance)
- access data in heap
- statistics and distribution
- reading an execution plan (chosen path) and check if appropriate
- data modification : its cost
- partitions : another access path


- why using indexes ? index theory
- access paths (index or heap) and filtering

- choose a path: costs (based on access type + estimated rows)
- reading an execution plan (chosen path) and check if appropriate
- practice: creating indexes and using them on `SELECT`
  - different data distribution
  - modifying data and updating statistics
  - use only execution plan to estimate execution time

Day 2 : performance 
- benchmarking using `pg_stat_statements`
- scaling : counter-intuitive phenomenons
  - latency of indirections in production
  - more capacity, not faster
- data modification : index update cost (1 index)

Day 3 : performance
- an overall view: end-to-end tests

Creation: 9 days

### Pre-requisite

[Basic](#basic--developers) 

How to make sure everybody knows the basics:
 - ask questions informally
 - submit MCQ
 - browse a codebase and ask for bugs

### Foundations

#### MVCC

Store multiple versions :
- dead rows
- bloating

Practice:
- create a dataset and update rows
- display dead rows: pg_dirty + views
- recover space using VACUUM
- setting up AUTOVACUUM

Concurrency:
- isolation level
- transaction
- locks ( include advisory lock on virtual resource ?) 

Practice:
- create transactions
- get locks (lock-tree)
- create a deadlock

#### Cache

Practice:
- querying the cache
- force eviction
- track ring buffer usage


### Observability

Server metrics:
- CPU
- RAM & swapping
- I/O : bandwidth, latency 

Database metrics and statistics :
- traffic
- table size and row count
- cache size, cache hit
- index usage

Identify running queries
- SQL text
- locks
- wait events

Get completed queries
- single-query logging (log in fs)
- aggregated logging: `pg_stats_stements`

### Debugging

Get execution plan

Read an execution plan:
- basic : estimation
- medium : actual (IO timings)
- [use web interface](https://explain.dalibo.com) 

### Access path

Key concepts:
- selectivity (strong - weak) and cardinality
- index 
- partitions

Practice:
- create index
- get use case when not used
- get use case when used

#### Gathering statistics

How are statistics sampled ? 
- number
- text

Query histograms views

When are statistics gathered ?

#### Import data

Practice : massive table loads
- load data
  - using streams : `COPY TO stdout | COPY FROM stdin`
  - using flat-file : `COPY TO` + `COPY FROM`
  - using plain SQL : `pg_dump` and `psql`
  - using custom format (archive) : `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`
- use `FREEZE` option
- disable constraints and indexes
- use `ANALYZE`

#### Remote data source
Foreign Data Wrapper


#### Indexing

Type:
- b-tree
- bitmap

Type:
- single colum
- composite
- function-based

Covering index

Drawbacks:
- redundancy (maintenance overhead)
- versioning side-effect (index rebuild)

Practice:
- design and create (simple, composite)
- check usage

#### Partioning

Select partition key

Create a partition

Check access time VS fullscan

Sub-partitioning

### Advanced data types

#### Text
Store and query text:
- fulltext search
- `pg_trgm`, fuzzystrmatch, Levenshtein

#### JSON
Store and query JSON

#### Binary 
Store and query binary: BLOB, BYTEA

#### Vector
`pg_vector`


### Application integration

#### Pool

max_connection

PaSzs and autoscaling

#### Native VS Query builder VS ORM

#### Transaction

How to abstract it in your domain ?

#### Automated tests

Integration tests: quick feedback VS protection against regression

Should you use an in-memory database : 
- when usage is in the soft spot;
- when to go out.


#### Application design (interaction with database) 

##### Primary key

UUID 

[v4 is bad for performance](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/unexpected-downsides-of-uuid-keys-in-postgresql/)

##### Hexagonal / clean architecture

When to do, when not to do

##### DDD

An aggregate :
- in a single table;
- in a dedicated schema.

Can you keep referential integrity between bounded context ?

#### deployment

ZDD (blue/green)
Preventing deadlocks 
Should you revert ? How to do it ?

#### APM and query correlation

DIY: monkey-patching 

On-the-shelf: openTelemetry (Js), Jaeger (Java)
